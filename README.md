## Contributing to RideSafe

Get ready to make your first contribution during Hacktoberfest! RideSafe is gearing up for an exciting update, inviting developers to sync up with us on GitHub. Introducing the Ride Safety Companion, a Flutter app designed to ensure your safety while riding in a vehicle. Using firebase, it checks the vehicle's number plate against a dataset, sharing past users experiences, giving you peace of mind. If the number plate is not stored in the database, the app tracks your ride and sends an SOS to your emergency contact if you don't reach your destination safely. But that's not all. It also allows you to provide feedback for the driver if you reach your destination safely. Experience a comprehensive solution for ride safety with the Ride Safety Companion app.

 ### Functions:
    - Check_database: checks if the vehicle's number plate is stored in the database
    - Track_ride: tracks the user's ride if the number plate is not stored in the database
    - Get_driver_feedback: takes feedback for the driver if the user reaches their destination safely
    - Send_sos: sends an SOS to the user's emergency contact if the user does not reach their destination safely
We're rolling out an open invitation for pull requests, making it easy for you to contribute and make a real impact. Join us on GitHub and let's sync up for an amazing Hacktoberfest! ðŸš€
